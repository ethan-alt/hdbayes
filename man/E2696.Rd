\description{
A data set from the ECOG E2696 trial comparing the combination of the GM2-KLH/QS-21 (GMK) vaccine
and high-dose interferon alfa-2b (IFN) therapy with the GMK vaccine alone in resected high-risk
melanoma patients. The study results were described in Kirkwood et al. (2001) \url{doi:10.1200/JCO.2001.19.5.1430}.
