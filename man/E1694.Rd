\format{
A data frame with 200 rows and 6 variables:
\describe{
\item{failtime}{relapse-free survival (RFS) times (in months)}
\item{failind}{relapse indicator, 0 = right censored, 1 = relapse}
\item{treatment}{treatment indicator, 0 = GMK, 1 = IFN}
\item{sex}{gender indicator, 0 = male, 1 = female}
\item{age}{patient age in years}
\item{perform}{ECOG performance status indicator, 0 = fully active patient, able to
carry on all pre-disease performance without restriction,
1 = restricted in physically strenuous activity, but are ambulatory
and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature}
}

E1694

\description{
A data set from the ECOG E1694 trial comparing the GM2-KLH/QS-21 (GMK) vaccine with high-dose
interferon alfa-2b (IFN) therapy in resected high-risk melanoma patients. The study results
were described in Kirkwood et al. (2001) \url{doi:10.1200/JCO.2001.19.9.2370}. This data set only
includes patients without nodal metastasis and has the same variables as the E2696 data set.
We can use the E2696 data as the historical data and the E1694 data as the current data.
