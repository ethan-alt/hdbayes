\arguments{
\item{formula}{a two-sided formula giving the relationship between the response variable and covariates}

\item{family}{an object of class \code{family}. See \code{\link[stats:family]{?stats::family}}}

\item{data.list}{a list of \code{data.frame}s. The first element in the list is the current data, and the rest
are the historical data sets.}

\item{tau}{a scalar or a vector whose dimension is equal to the number of regression coefficients giving
the commensurate prior parameters. If a scalar is provided, tau will be a vector of repeated
elements of the given scalar. Each element of tau must be positive, corresponding to a normal
precision parameter.}

\item{offset.list}{a list of vectors giving the offsets for each data. The length of offset.list is equal to
the length of data.list. The length of each element of offset.list is equal to the number
of rows in the corresponding element of data.list. Defaults to a list of vectors of 0s.}

\item{beta0.mean}{a scalar or a vector whose dimension is equal to the number of regression coefficients
giving the mean parameters for the prior on the historical data regression coefficients. If a
scalar is provided, same as for tau. Defaults to a vector of 0s.}

\item{beta0.sd}{a scalar or a vector whose dimension is equal to the number of regression coefficients giving
the sd parameters for the prior on the historical data regression coefficients. If a scalar is
provided, same as for tau. Defaults to a vector of 10s.}

\item{disp.mean}{a scalar or a vector whose dimension is equal to the number of data sets (including the current
data) giving the means for the half-normal priors on the dispersion parameters. If a scalar is
provided, same as for tau. Defaults to a vector of 0s.}

\item{disp.sd}{a scalar or a vector whose dimension is equal to the number of data sets (including the current
data) giving the sds for the half-normal priors on the dispersion parameters. If a scalar is
provided, same as for tau. Defaults to a vector of 10s.}

\item{iter_warmup}{number of warmup iterations to run per chain. Defaults to 1000. See the argument \code{iter_warmup} in
\code{sample()} method in cmdstanr package.}

\item{iter_sampling}{number of post-warmup iterations to run per chain. Defaults to 1000. See the argument \code{iter_sampling}
in \code{sample()} method in cmdstanr package.}

\item{chains}{number of Markov chains to run. Defaults to 4. See the argument \code{chains} in \code{sample()} method in
cmdstanr package.}

\item{...}{arguments passed to \code{sample()} method in cmdstanr package (e.g. seed, refresh, init).}
}
\value{
The function returns an object of class \code{draws_df} giving posterior samples.

\description{
Sample from the posterior distribution of a GLM using the CP by Hobbs et al. (2011) \url{doi:10.1111/j.1541-0420.2011.01564.x}.
}
\details{
The CP assumes that the regression coefficients for the current data conditional on those for the historical
data are independent normal distributions with mean equal to the corresponding regression coefficients
for the historical data and variance equal to the inverse of the corresponding elements of a user-specified
vector (tau) of precision parameters. The number of current data regression coefficients is assumed to be the
same as that of historical data regression coefficients. The priors on the dispersion parameters (if applicable)
for the current and historical data sets are independent half-normal distributions.
