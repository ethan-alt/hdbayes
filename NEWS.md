# hdbayes 0.2.0 (development version)

## Enhancements

* Added functions for computing model averaging weights using Bayesian model averaging (BMA), pseudo-BMA, pseudo-BMA+ (pseudo-BMA 
with the Bayesian bootstrap), and stacking. Also added a function for generating samples from the ensemble of posterior distributions 
based on the computed weights.

* Added functions for sampling from the posterior distributions of various several models, including the accelerated failure 
time (AFT) model, the piecewise exponential (PWE) model, and the mixture cure rate model with a PWE component for the non-cured 
popluation (CurePWE). For all survival model implementations, multiple historical data sets are now stacked into a single 
combined data set for model fitting.

* Added functions to compute the log marginal likelihood for the AFT, PWE, and CurePWE models under various prior specifications.

* Updated the implementation of generalized linear models (GLMs) to support computation of the pointwise log-likelihood matrix. This 
enables downstream use in model comparison and averaging procedures, such as computing pseudo-BMA and stacking weights. 

* Added lower and upper bounds for probability of being exchangeable for LEAP implementation for GLM models.

* Modified the output of the `glm.rmap()` function to include the updated mixture weight for the posterior density under the MAP prior.


# hdbayes 0.1.1

## Enhancements

* Added functions for computing the logarithm of the marginal likelihood of a GLM under all priors implemented in the package.

* Updated the implementation of commensurate prior to be fully Bayesian.

* Updated the implementation of robust meta-analytic predictive prior (RMAP) from using a Gaussian mixture model to approximate the MAP prior to computing the updated mixture weights based on marginal likelihoods. Specifically, we removed `glm.rmap.bhm()` and `glm.rmap.bhm.approx()` functions. The posterior samples from using the RMAP now can be obtained via calling `glm.rmap()` function directly.

* Added function for sampling from the posterior distribution of a GLM under a normal/half-normal prior.

* Added the vignette "AIDS_Progression".

* Updated Stan files for NAPP and NPP by eliciting priors on logit(a0) instead of a0. 

* Added two data sets: E1684 and E1690.


## Bug Fixes

* Fixed bugs in checking input `offset.list` for `glm.leap()`.

* Fixed bugs in computing normalizing constants for normal and Gamma models using `glm.npp.lognc()`.

* Fixed bugs in renaming/reordering output variables in `glm.bhm()`.


# hdbayes 0.0.3

* First CRAN release.
